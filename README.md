## Summary
It is about having an artificial intelligence system that helps in psychological diagnosis. But not through tests, as was usually done, but through cameras that analyze the patient's expressions while he/she explains his/her problem and talk to the psychologist.

## Background
It is about solving diagnostic problems when this diagnosis is not clear. It is a common problem in psychology. I am motivated by this question because I study psychology at university.
In some practices the diagnosis is not very clear and I think this type of AI system could be very useful.
## How is it used?
It will be used by psychologists in their consultations as a means of confirming diagnoses made by them. Patients may request that these recordings be used for diagnostic purposes only. If they were used for other purposes it would be harmful to them.
## Data sources and AI methods
Previous data on facial expressions of patients with certain diagnoses are needed.
There must be a lot of data of this type in the system database.
The technique that can be used is the neural network. There will be several nodes that will provide information about each of the facial characteristics analyzed.
## Challenges
The system should be used as support, and not as the basis of a diagnosis. Other tests performed by the psychologist will confirm or not the diagnosis.
## What next?
Each psychologist should be able to calibrate the system depending on the characteristics of the patients he/she serve and depending on his/her own professional experience.
